From 1995-2025 action movies only made up of 1,332 movies, beaten out by drama, comedy, documentary, and thriller/suspense, respectively. @cr-pie1

```{r}

```
:::

But in that same period, action movies grossed $60,465,518,435 making it second to adventure movies[^1] with $66,777,466,481. It's worth noting that drama is the third highest at $37,727,901,915 which is about two-thirds of what action movies made. @cr-pie2

[^1]: [the very slight difference between action and adventure is that former is associated with a particular kind of scene or spectacle; whereas the latter implies a story.](https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/action-and-adventure-films#:~:text=Action%20is%20associated%20with%20a,in%20such%20films%20as%20King)

@cr-bar1 You can see here are the movies from 1995-2024, the top grossing action movies each year (in ascending order).

:::{.callout-note}
2025 was removed here because the year is not complete.

```{r}

:::

:::{.callout-warning}
It is most likely that 2020 is significantly lower due to the COVID-19 pandemic and overall closures in that period.
:::

@cr-bar2 Here is the same plot reorganized in descending adjusted gross. And we can see here that the top grossing action movies between 1995-2024 are Black Panther, Jurassic World, Gun: Maverick, Men in Black, and Wonder Woman.

:::{#cr-bar2}
```{r}
#| out-width: 100%

@cr-bar3 And of these movies, only 2 have female leads. There are some with supporting female characters but they are (often) the only female representation in the main cast.

How do we tie this back to International Women's Day? Though actions movies overall is a boys' club there are some stand out female characters in action movies. 

@cr-thegang Let's celebrate action movies with (kick-ass) female leads. A few come to mind ...

## Honourable mentions to:

- Viola Davis (Woman King)
- Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider, Eternals, Salt, etc.)
- Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality)
- Jennifer Lawrence (Hunger Games)
- Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman)

## Future thoughts ...

- Lead roles vs. in the cast
- Director or other roles
- Delve deeper into subgenres:
    - Superheroes
    - Book-to-movie
- Intersectionality
    - Bechdal test
