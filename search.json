The total amount of winnable points is 120. Find out more information about roles of the Big and the Smalls here.\n\n\n\nThis game requires a normal playing deck minus several cards. Keep only the following cards of all suits: 7, 8 ,9, 10, J, Q, K, A. This means a game will only consist of 8 * 4 = 32 cards.\n\n\nDeal out 10 cards to each player with 2 cards in the middle, faced down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSince there are so few cards, shuffling is very important to avoid cards sticking together. Once the cards are shuffled, the player on the right needs to cut the deck.\n\n\nYou have the dealer, the first person left of the dealer (Player 1 or P1), and the player right of the dealer (Player 2 or P2).\nYou deal clockwise in the following order:\n\n[2 to P1, 2 to P2 & 2 to the dealer] * 2\nDeal 2 to the centre\n[2 to P1, 2 to P2 & 2 to the dealer] * 2\n\nNow that the cards are dealt, the roles have to be determined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can play one of two roles:\n\nBig\nSmall\n\nThe Smalls team up together against the Big (i.e., 2 vs. 1).\nIdeally, if you think you can win on your own you take the role of the Big; otherwise you take the role of one of the two Smalls.\nStarting to the left of the dealer, P1 will decide if they will take on the role of Big. If they decline then it goes to P2 and if P2 declines it goes to the dealer. Once someone decides to be the Big then the roles are determined for that round. A playe signals that they have decided to be the Big if they collect the 2 cards in the centre. This player starts the game by adding 2 cards from their hand into their points pile, facedown.\n\n\n\nLike most trick-taking games, the play is determined by the first action. Therefore, if the first player puts down a trump then all players must follow suit, unless they are unable and in which case they can play any card. Whoever wins the trick gets to start off the next one and so on and so forth until all cards are played. If you win a trick then you get to collect those cards that were played. The Big has their own points and the Smalls pool their points together.

Whoever wins the trick gets to start off the next one and so on and so forth until all cards are played. If you win a trick then you get to collect those cards that were played. The Big has their own points and the Smalls pool their points together. Once all cards have been played then you collect and count your points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump cardsNon-trump cards\n\n\nBelow is a list of the trumps cards, ranked in order of strength:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nCard\nSuit\n\n\n\n\n1\nQ\nClub {{&lt; fa clover &gt;}}\n\n\n2\nQ\nSpade {{&lt; fa spoon &gt;}}\n\n\n3\nQ\nHeart {{&lt; fa heart &gt;}}\n\n\n4\nQ\nDiamond {{&lt; fa diamond &gt;}}\n\n\n5\nJ\nClub {{&lt; fa clover &gt;}}\n\n\n6\nJ\nSpade {{&lt; fa spoon &gt;}}\n\n\n7\nJ\nHeart {{&lt; fa heart &gt;}}\n\n\n8\nJ\nDiamond {{&lt; fa diamond &gt;}}\n\n\n9\n10\nDiamond {{&lt; fa diamond &gt;}}\n\n\n10\nA\nDiamond {{&lt; fa diamond &gt;}}\n\n\n11\nK\nDiamond {{&lt; fa diamond &gt;}}\n\n\n12\n9\nDiamond {{&lt; fa diamond &gt;}}\n\n\n13\n8\nDiamond {{&lt; fa diamond &gt;}}\n\n\n14\n7\nDiamond {{&lt; fa diamond &gt;}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis order isn’t a commonly seen order; note that the K is lower than the 10!\n\n\nAll other cards are non-trump.\n\n\nBelow are the non-trump cards, ranked in order of strength:\n\n\n\n#\nCard\n\n\n\n\n1\n10\n\n\n2\nK\n\n\n3\n9\n\n\n4\n8\n\n\n5\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis applies to all clubs, all spades, and all hearts (minus Q & J).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaying the BigPlaying the Smalls\n\n\nYou typically take this role if you feel like you can win against the other 2 players.

This plot also separates the solves which I refer to as “check status” here, meaning thatif it was solved without any reveals and within the time limit it’s a legit solve, otherwise we’ll refer to it as checkked–which isn’t as fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo this plot is telling us that Mondays are the easiest solves with the highest count (by far) but it doesn’t really give us a fulsome picture. If we were to just take this as is, we’d see that about half the Mondays solves are legit, whereas the remaining solves needed an extra little nudge.\n\n\nLet’s look at our progress over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see we’re real keen early on, there’s a bit of a dip in 2020 but we’re up again in 2021 and 2022. Of course, we’re still early in 2023 so there’s always room for potential there. So it looks at a glance that the legit Monday solves are slowly increasing but we can confirm this by digging into the data a little bit more.\n\n\nSolved Monday crosswords\n\nWe’re omitting 2023 from these anlayses because they’ll throw off the mean and regression models since this year in incomplete.\n\n\nMeanLinear model\n\n\nThis line plot shows solved Mondays by their check status. The solid lines show the count of solved Mondays and the dotted lines show the average (or mean) per respective check status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see here we’re above the average in 2018, 2019, and 2022.\n\n\nThis line plot shows solved Mondays by their check status. The solid lines show the count of solved Mondays and the dotted lines show the regression line (using a linear model).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legit line looks pretty steady here, which is at least that seeing that there is a decrease for the non-legit solves."

Ideally, and it’s what we’re seeing here, that the time to complete Monday crosswords is decreasing over time. Looking at the time completion is another take on the data to see if there’s any improvement in our crosswording.\n\nMondaysTuesdays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data for Tuesdays isn’t as good as for the Mondays because it was only recently we graduated to being able to do Tuesdays consistently."

So as we’ve become more comfortable with crosswords we’ve been going back into the archives–and sometimes I’ve gone into the archives on my own–to do Mondays. So for this last plot, we look at solved crosswords that weren’t checked or had the answers revealed. This plot supports and potentially explains some weird behaviours seen in the above plots. This plot also includes a dotted line to indicate the average number of solved crosswords that were not checked or revealed from 2018 to 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy this plot is important is to consider things outside of what you see in the data to explain the data. But this is only the beginning of data exploration!\nI hope you’ve enjoyed this brief analysis of our NYT crossword journey :smile:"
