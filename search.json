The official rules and terminology were published by the Latvian Zole Game Federation in 1996.\n\n\n\nYou or your team want to win the most amount of points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a list of what each card is valued at:\n\n\n\nCard\nValue\n\n\n\n\nA\n11\n\n\n10\n10\n\n\nK\n4\n\n\nQ\n3\n\n\nJ\n2\n\n\n&lt;9\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re the Big you want to win 61+ points and if you’re the Small team you want to win 60+ points. The total amount of winnable points is 120. Find out more information about roles of the Big and the Smalls here.\n\n\n\nThis game requires a normal playing deck minus several cards. The deck consists of all of the A, K, Q, J, tens, and nines, plus the 8 and 7 of diamonds; therefore, 26 cards are used for this game.\n\n\nDeal out 8 cards to each player with 2 cards in the middle, faced down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSince there are so few cards, shuffling is very important to avoid cards sticking together. Once the cards are shuffled, the player on the right needs to cut the deck.\n\n\nYou have the dealer, the first person left of the dealer (Player 1 or P1), and the player right of the dealer (Player 2 or P2).\nYou deal clockwise in the following order:\n\n4 to P1, 4 to P2 & 4 to the dealer\nDeal 2 to the centre\n4 to P1, 4 to P2 & 4 to the dealer\n\nNow that the cards are dealt, the roles have to be determined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can play one of two roles:\n\nBig\nSmall\n\nThe Smalls team up together against the Big (i.e., 2 vs. 1).\nIdeally, if you think you can win on your own you take the role of the Big; otherwise you take the role of one of the two Smalls.\nStarting to the left of the dealer, P1 will decide if they will take on the role of Big. If they decline then it goes to P2 and if P2 declines it goes to the dealer. Once someone decides to be the Big then the roles are determined for that round. A playe signals that they have decided to be the Big if they collect the 2 cards in the centre. This player starts the game by adding 2 cards from their hand into their points pile, facedown.\n\n\n\nLike most trick-taking games, the play is determined by the first action. Therefore, if the first player puts down a trump then all players must follow suit, unless they are unable and in which case they can play any card. Whoever wins the trick gets to start off the next one and so on and so forth until all cards are played. If you win a trick then you get to collect those cards that were played. The Big has their own points and the Smalls pool their points together. Once all cards have been played then you collect and count your points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump cardsNon-trump cards\n\n\nBelow is a list of the trumps cards, ranked in order of strength:\n\n\n\n#\nCard\n\n\n\n\n1\nQ♣\n\n\n2\nQ♠\n\n\n3\nQ♥\n\n\n4\nQ♦\n\n\n5\nJ♣\n\n\n6\nJ♠\n\n\n7\nJ♥\n\n\n8\nJ♦\n\n\n9\nA♦\n\n\n10\n10♦\n\n\n11\nK♦\n\n\n12\n9♦\n\n\n13\n8♦\n\n\n14\n7♦\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis order isn’t a commonly seen order; note that the K is lower than the 10!\n\n\nAll other cards are non-trump.\n\n\nBelow are the non-trump cards, ranked in order of strength:\n\n\n\n#\nCard\n\n\n\n\n1\n10♦\n\n\n2\nK♦\n\n\n3\n9♦\n\n\n4\n8♦\n\n\n5\n7♦\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis applies to all clubs, all spades, and all hearts (minus Q & J).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaying the BigPlaying the Smalls\n\n\nYou typically take this role if you feel like you can win against the other 2 players.

If they decline then it goes to P2 and if P2 declines it goes to the dealer. Once someone decides to be the Big then the roles are determined for that round. A playe signals that they have decided to be the Big if they collect the 2 cards in the centre.

Therefore, if the first player puts down a trump then all players must follow suit, unless they are unable and in which case they can play any card. Whoever wins the trick gets to start off the next one and so on and so forth until all cards are played. If you win a trick then you get to collect those cards that were played.

What jumps out is that seasons 1 & 2 are fairly short. It’s reasonable for pilot seasons to be shorter but a quick search shows that there were fewer episodes in season 2 due to a schedule conflict1. We also see a slight dip in season 14 and that’s likely a result of the SAG-AFTRA writer’s strike in 20232."

The other downside with this graph is that it’s hard to tell when a season starts and ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also love a scatter plot when there’s a lot of data points. Here, we see more clumps above the average in the earlier seasons and that they move more under the average in the later seasons. This aligns with the story we see in the ridgeline graph–which makes sense because it’s all the same data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here, by adding a fitted linear model, the trend seen in the previous graph is made more apparent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI figured changing the perspective from release date to episode might show some sort of pattern, e.g., season premieres or finales scoring higher–spoiler it doesn’t seem so. I also figured this would remove the space when there’s breaks between when episodes are released.\n\n\n\nOf the 14 seasons of Bob’s Burgers, there are 275 episodes. I’m going to now look at the bottom and top 25 episodes. I recognize that it’s only 9% of the episodes but for now this is just a quick look."

In my opinion, this is by far not the best episode. Additionally, I would rank Thanksgiving episodes above the Christmas episodes. I might even rank the Halloween episodes above the Christmas ones … maybe this needs more investigation.\n\n\n\n\nWas this episode a season finale?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI always just figured shows like to start off with a bang or end on a great note but maybe that’s not the case.

This plot also separates the solves which I refer to as “check status” here, meaning thatif it was solved without any reveals and within the time limit it’s a legit solve, otherwise we’ll refer to it as checked–which isn’t as fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo this plot is telling us that Mondays are the easiest solves with the highest count (by far) but it doesn’t really give us a fulsome picture. If we were to just take this as is, we’d see that about half the Mondays solves are legit, whereas the remaining solves needed an extra little nudge.\n\n\nLet’s look at our progress over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see we’re real keen early on, there’s a bit of a dip in 2020 but we’re up again in 2021 and 2022. Of course, we’re still early in 2023 so there’s always room for potential there. So it looks at a glance that the legit Monday solves are slowly increasing but we can confirm this by digging into the data a little bit more.\n\n\nSolved Monday crosswords\n\nWe’re omitting 2023 from these anlayses because they’ll throw off the mean and regression models since this year in incomplete.\n\n\nMeanLinear model\n\n\nThis line plot shows solved Mondays by their check status. The solid lines show the count of solved Mondays and the dotted lines show the average (or mean) per respective check status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see here we’re above the average in 2018, 2019, and 2022.\n\n\nThis line plot shows solved Mondays by their check status. The solid lines show the count of solved Mondays and the dotted lines show the regression line (using a linear model).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legit line looks pretty steady here, which is at least that seeing that there is a decrease for the non-legit solves."

So as we’ve become more comfortable with crosswords we’ve been going back into the archives–and sometimes I’ve gone into the archives on my own–to do Mondays. So for this last plot, we look at solved crosswords that weren’t checked or had the answers revealed. This plot supports and potentially explains some weird behaviours seen in the above plots. This plot also includes a dotted line to indicate the average number of solved crosswords that were not checked or revealed from 2018 to 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy this plot is important is to consider things outside of what you see in the data to explain the data.
